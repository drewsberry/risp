Risp
=====

This is a very basic implementation of a Lisp interpreter/compiler.

It was originally written in **Ruby**, hence *Risp*.
It has since been ported to **Python**, hence *Pisp*.

The interpreter/compiler is currently limited to nested S-expressions and global
variables. Work is currently underway to incorporate local variables.
